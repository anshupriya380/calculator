# JavaScript Calculator Project

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
I'm excited to share my latest project with you all â€“ a **JavaScript Calculator** that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project was both challenging and rewarding, and I wanted to highlight some of the key concepts and technologies I used.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts and Technologies
### 1. HTML & CSS for Structure and Styling
- Utilized semantic HTML for the structure.
- Employed Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive design, ensuring a clean and modern UI.

### 2. JavaScript for Functionality
- Implemented event listeners to handle button clicks.
- Used the `eval()` function to compute the mathematical expressions entered by the user.
- Ensured smooth interaction by updating the input field dynamically.

### 3. Responsive Design
- The calculator is fully responsive, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Leveraged Tailwind CSS utility classes for a flexible and adaptive layout.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Highlights
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Clean and minimalistic design for a seamless user experience.
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant feedback on button clicks with real-time updates to the input field.
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Designed to be accessible for both mouse and keyboard users.
